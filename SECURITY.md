## Supported Versions

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 0.x     | :x:                |
| 1.x     | :white_check_mark: |

You may also build `lbadd` from source, from any commit you want.
Be aware, that these custom-built versions are not supported at all.
Feel free to report any errors anyway, but it is highly likely that we just recommend you to switch to another commit.

When building from source, please always use the latest version of Go that is available.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you detect a vulnerability, please open a common issue.
As there is no release intended for production use, vulnerabilities are not required to be handled critically yet.
This will change as soon as we have our first production release.
See issue [#92](https://github.com/tomarrell/lbadd/issues/92) for more info.
